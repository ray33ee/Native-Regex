## [Unreleased]
### To Do
- Make sure `CharacterSet::from` contains no overlapping ranges
- Add clap support for
  - Entering and verifying the regex
  - Selecting and verifying the output language
- Convert translate.rs from functional to object-oriented rust_translator.rs
- Add a bunch of helper functions that act as a wrapper around the Native Regex function and implement as close to the `regex` crate as possible, including
 - Matching
 - Capturing
 - Regex sets
- Change return type of generated function from a vector to a HashMap<String, &str> to prepare for named capture groups

### Unfinished Ideas
